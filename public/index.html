    <h4>Published by: Jordan Bryan</h4>
    <p>3-D printing is a beautiful hobby to pick up due to its multitude of applications.
      The technology has become cheap enough for the general consumer market and has revolutionized the industry.
      Social media website and other file sharing locations take advantage of the number of printers in commission today.
      These sites allow for ordering of printed parts as well as the collaboration that is highly beneficial for novices.
      You don't need to be a 3-D modeling pro to be able to get the practical use out of your printer. So many designs are shared for 
      free online and anyone can modify or print these designs to suit their needs.

    <p>While many look at 3-D printing as an alien technology the field can be broken into with a $200 investment.
      A great beginning 3-D printer is the Monoprice 3-D Select <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Select-Mini-Printer-Assembled/dp/B01FL49VZE/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1548788330&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=monoprice+3d+printer&psc=1">(Buy Here)</a>
      The same printer is shown below with a 120x120x120mm heated print bed it provides enough space for small models, or modular parts for larger ones. The entry level
